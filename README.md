# wp-split-csv

This plugin is starter code for taking a CSV uploaded into the WordPress media library and splitting it into multiple files,
with a specific number of rows per file. This plugin is not intended to be used directly, just sample code only a base to start with.
Copy the `split_csv()` function into your own codebase and use it as you see fit.
